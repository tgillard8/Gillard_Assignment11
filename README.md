# Card Schemas
### Purpose
Housing the properties of a 52 card deck. Includes dictionaries based off of their  suits and values.
### Input
No direct inputs. This code functions as a dictionary for the value and suit of a deck of cards.
### Expected Output
Prints the dictionaries of cards, encompassing both their value and the type of card that populates each suit (which is pretty uniform).
### Execution
Just primarily operates as a dictionary, housing information relative to the cards.
### Improvements
Allow for further game mechanics and more complex user inputs that operate based off of the input dictionaries.

# Protein Coder
### Purpose
Tranlate an RNA sequence into a protein. Help user understand how genetic info is transformed.
### Input
Input is an RNA sequence, characters such as A or G.
### Expected Output
Expected output is the protein string that resembles the input RNA sequence.
### Execution
Most of the exeuction of this code is done via the codon table at the top of the code. 'Translate' handles the translation.
### Improvements
Allow the processing of multiple chunks of RNA sequencing. Allow for further computations beyond just RNA to protein translation?
